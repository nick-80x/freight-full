# Test Coverage Analysis

Analyze and improve test coverage for: $ARGUMENTS

Steps:

1. **Run Coverage Report**
   ```bash
   npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false
   ```

2. **Identify Coverage Gaps**
   - Lines not covered
   - Branches not tested
   - Functions never called
   - Statements not executed

3. **Prioritize Missing Tests**
   - Critical business logic
   - Error handling paths
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Integration points

4. **Add Missing Tests**
   - Write tests for uncovered lines
   - Test all conditional branches
   - Cover error scenarios
   - Test async operations

5. **Verify Improvement**
   - Re-run coverage report
   - Ensure threshold is met (85%+)
   - Review coverage details
   - Update CI/CD if needed

Target: 85%+ coverage across all metrics (lines, branches, functions, statements)
