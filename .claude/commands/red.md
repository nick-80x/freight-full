# TDD Red Phase

Create a failing test for: $ARGUMENTS

Steps:
1. Identify the behavior to test
2. Write a test that describes the expected behavior
3. Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
4. Include edge cases and error conditions
5. Run the test to confirm it fails
6. Commit with: "test: add failing test for $ARGUMENTS"

Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern:
- **Arrange**: Set up test data and mocks
- **Act**: Execute the function/method being tested  
- **Assert**: Verify the expected outcome
