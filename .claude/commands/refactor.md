# TDD Refactor Phase

Improve the implementation for: $ARGUMENTS while keeping tests green

Refactoring opportunities:
1. Extract duplicated code into functions
2. Improve variable and function names
3. Simplify complex conditional logic
4. Optimize performance if needed
5. Add proper error handling
6. Improve code organization and structure

Rules:
- Run tests after each small change
- If tests break, revert and try smaller steps
- Commit frequently with: "refactor: improve $ARGUMENTS implementation"
- Don't change test behavior, only implementation
