# TDD Green Phase

Implement minimum code to make tests pass for: $ARGUMENTS

Guidelines:
1. Write only enough code to make the failing test pass
2. Don't add extra functionality not covered by tests
3. Use the simplest implementation that works
4. Run tests frequently to ensure they pass
5. Don't worry about code quality yet (that's for refactor phase)
6. Commit with: "feat: implement $ARGUMENTS to pass tests"

Focus on making tests green, not on perfect code.
